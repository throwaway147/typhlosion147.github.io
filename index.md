Lately, my main project that I have been working on is buying a few cheap domains, acquiring some pretty funky email addresses, and setting up my own email server that I share with others.

With the emails that I have obtained, I've managed to get the following: admin@bakunet.me admin@shadowsynth.xyz admin@did-i.win and thisisthe@national.shitposting.society

If you have any requests for email addresses, simply send an email [here](mailto:chosensoundmusic147@gmail.com)

Alright, so I will be using this as a blog for my English Class,  so here it is.


So, a few of my projects that I've been working on have been things like doing remakes of music from Pokemon games, working with game servers and websites, this blog page, and even my own screenshot server.

 Here is an example of what I have been doing with the music:
